    <p class="textBox gapTop gapBottom">Hole recorded the <em>Live Through This</em> album in October 1993. It was
    produced by Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie. Most of the tracks were
    mixed by either Slade or Scott Litt and the exception was Gutless which was mixed by J Mascis
    of Dinosaur Jr.</p>

    <p class="textBox gapTop">The release of the album was somewhat overshadowed by the suicide of
    frontwoman Courtney Love's husband Kurt Cobain which took place seven days
    prior. In a tragic turn of events, the band's bassist Kristen Pfaff also
    died of a heroin overdose two months after the album's release.</p>

        <p class="mainText">Hole recorded the <em>Live Through This</em> album in October 1993. It was
        produced by Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie. Most of the tracks were
        mixed by either Slade or Scott Litt and the exception was Gutless which was mixed by J Mascis
        of Dinosaur Jr.</p>

        <p class="mainText" id="closeGapMobile">The release of the album was somewhat overshadowed by the suicide of
        frontwoman Courtney Love's husband Kurt Cobain which took place seven days
        prior. In a tragic turn of events, the band's bassist Kristen Pfaff also
        died of a heroin overdose two months after the album's release.</p>
